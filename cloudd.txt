WHAT IS CLOUD COMPUTING?
It is a technology that uses remote servers on the internet to store, manage, and access data online rather than local drives. 
The data can be anything such as files, images, documents, audio, video, and more

Characteristics of Cloud Computing
1) AgilityThe cloud works in a distributed computing environment. It shares resources among users and works very fast.

2) High availability and reliability

The availability of servers is high and more reliable because the chances of infrastructure failure are minimum.


3) High Scalability

Cloud offers "on-demand" provisioning of resources on a large scale, without having engineers for peak loads.

4) Multi-Sharing

With the help of cloud computing, multiple users and applications can work more efficiently with cost reductions by sharing common infrastructure.
